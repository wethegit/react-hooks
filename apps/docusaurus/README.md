# Documentation

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/).

The documentation will be built and deployed to GitHub Pages automatically when a commit is pushed to the `main` branch.

### Installation

```
$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
