# react-hooks

A collection of helpers for use in React projects.

[Documentation](https://wethegit.github.io/react-hooks/)

## Development

### Setup

```bash
git clone
cd react-hooks
yarn
```

### Running the docs

This will make Vite run a production build with `--watch` so you can develop the docs while still being able to tweak the hooks.

```bash
yarn start
```

### Running the package and playground

```bash
cd packages/wethegit-react-hooks
yarn dev
```
