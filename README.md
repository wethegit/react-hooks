# react-hooks

A collection of helpers for use in React projects.

[Documentation](https://wethegit.github.io/react-hooks/)

## Development

### Setup

Clone repo, make sure you are using the correct version of [Node](./.nvmrc), and install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

### Running the docs

This will make Vite run a production build with `--watch` for the **hooks** so you can develop the docs while still being able to tweak them.

```bash
yarn start
```

### Running the package and playground

If you'd like to work on hooks in isolation and see them in action, you can run the playground:

```bash
cd packages/wethegit-react-hooks
yarn dev
```
