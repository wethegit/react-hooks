 * @param {Function} asyncFn - The asynchronous function to run
 * @param {Boolean} [deferred=false] - whether to save the function to a variable
 * for later use (true) or run it instantly (false).
 * @returns {Object} Properties include a run() function which is used to subsequently
 * call the function (if deferred); the resulting data; and the status and error states.
 *
 * @example
 * Run it instantly:
 * const { data, status, error } = useAsync(fetch("https://my-cool-api.com/some-endpoint"))
 * console.log(data)
 *
 * Deferred execution:
 * const { run, data, status, error } = useAsync(fetch("https://my-cool-api.com/some-endpoint"))
 * const handleClick = (event) => run()
 *
